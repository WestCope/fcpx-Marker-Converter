# Final Cut Pro X Marker Converter

FCPX currently doesn't have the ability to export markers to Compressor. This app converts markers from a .fcpxml file to a .txt file that can be imported into compressor

## Usage

### Export project xml file
In the Final Cut Pro X project browser, highlight a project and select "File" => "Export XML".

### Option 1
Open MarkerConverter.app. An open dialog allows you to select your .fcpxml file and convert it to a text file.

### Option 2
Drag your .fcpxml file onto the MarkerConverter.app icon. You'll be asked where to save the output text file.

## Notes
This app finds all markers within the entire project, even those within compound clips.
